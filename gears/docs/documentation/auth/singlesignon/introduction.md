## Single Sign On

One of Feather's design goals is to easily and effortlessly allow existing applications with an existing user base to integrate and interact with Feather. What this boils down to is a seemless transition from your application to the forums. No longer will your users have to remember two or more passwords for your application.

Before using a single sign on provider there are a few things you must consider.

1. If you've been maintaining a separate user base for your forum and your application for any period and have numerous users in both some users may be required to link there accounts on there initial visit to the forum.
2. A [forum migration](/migrations) and a single sign on provider can not be used in conjunction with each other. If you're migrating from an existing forum then it's recommended that you migrate users for a period of time before enabling single sign on.
